# The average radius

Let's also review the final method of simplifying the data set that we have discussed during the previous weeks.  Please add code in the panel on the left here so as to calculate the average radius of the bubbles using:

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i)

The variable `xbar` should be set equal to the average radius of the bubble in order to pass the test.   To get you started I have loaded the data from the file `bubbles.dat` into the NumPy array called `radii`.  These radius values should be used for the ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_i) values in the above formulas.
